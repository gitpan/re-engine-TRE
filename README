NAME
    re::engine::TRE - TRE regular expression engine

VERSION
    version 0.07

SYNOPSIS
        use re::engine::TRE max_cost => 1;

        if ("A pearl is a hard object produced..." =~ /\(Perl\)/i) {
            say $1; # "pearl"
        }

DESCRIPTION
    Replaces Perl's regex engine in a given lexical scope with POSIX regular
    expressions provided by the TRE regular expression library. tre-0.8.0
    <http://laurikari.net/tre/download/> is shipped with this module.

PRAGMA OPTIONS
    *   "cost_ins": The default cost of an inserted character, that is, an
        extra character in string (default: 1).

    *   "cost_del": The default cost of a deleted character, that is, a
        character missing from string (default: 1).

    *   "cost_subst": The default cost of a substituted character (default:
        1).

    *   "max_cost": The maximum allowed cost of a match. If this is set to
        zero, an exact matching is searched for (default: 0).

    *   "max_ins": Maximum allowed number of inserted characters (default:
        unspecified).

    *   "max_del": Maximum allowed number of deleted characters (default:
        unspecified).

    *   "max_subst": Maximum allowed number of substituted characters
        (default: unspecified).

    *   "max_err": Maximum allowed number of errors (inserts + deletes +
        substitutes; default: unspecified).

    Set any value to -1 to represent "unspecified, but very high".
